# 🚀 Welcome to My GitHub! 😎  

## 🔥 About Me:
Hey there! I'm a **20-year-old** developer from **Hessen, Germany** 🇩🇪, obsessed with **big projects** and writing code that (mostly) works.  

### 🛠 Tech Stack:
🟢 **Python** | 🟡 **JavaScript** | 🔵 **C#** | 🔴 **C++**  

- 🚀 **Passionate** about high-performance systems, scalable apps & breaking limits.  
- 🌍 **Open-Source Enthusiast** – Sharing my code with the world!  
- 🎯 **Goal**: Write fewer bugs than features.  

> 💡 **"A Python script a day keeps the Java away."** – Me 😆

## 🌟 Fun Facts:  
🎮 **Gaming Mode:** I type faster in a clutch than in a job interview.  
🛠 **Debugging Strategy:** `console.log("It works... hopefully")`  
🐍 **Python Lover:** The only snake I trust with my life.  
💻 **Commit Messages:** A mix of *"Fixing stuff"* & *"I have no idea why this works"*.  
⚡ **Developer Instincts:** If my code runs on the first try... I get suspicious.  
🧑‍💻 **Coding Philosophy:** "Why write comments when I can just suffer later?"  
💾 **Storage Space:** 90% is taken up by failed project ideas and memes.

💡 Currently building **something BIG** – stay tuned!
